ðŸ“Š Structure of Tips Dataset:  
You can load it in the following manner:  
```python  
import seaborn as sns  
tips = sns.load_dataset("tips")  
print(tips.head())  
```  
Typical columns:  
- **total_bill** â†’ Total monetary amount of the bill (in dollars).  
- **tip** â†’ Gratuity provided by the patron (in dollars).  
- **sex** â†’ Gender of the patron ("Male" or "Female").  
- **smoker** â†’ Indicator of whether the patron is a smoker ("Yes" or "No").  
- **day** â†’ Day of the week (Thur, Fri, Sat, Sun).  
- **time** â†’ Meal period ("Lunch" or "Dinner").  
- **size** â†’ Number of individuals at the table.  
ðŸ”Ž How to analyze with graphs  
- **Distribution of Total Bill**
- If the bar is high â†’ many people spent around that amount.
```python  
sns.histplot(tips['total_bill'], kde=True)  
```  
ðŸ‘‰ Illustrates the distribution of total bills.  
- **Relationship between Bill & Tip**
- If dots go upwards diagonally â†’ bigger bills give bigger tips. 
```python  
sns.scatterplot(x="total_bill", y="tip", data=tips)  
```  
ðŸ‘‰ Typically, higher bills correlate with higher tips (demonstrating a linear relationship).  
- **Average Tip by Gender**
- If the bar for "Male" is taller â†’ men usually tip more.
```python  
sns.barplot(x="sex", y="tip", data=tips)  
```  
ðŸ‘‰ Compares the average gratuity extended by male and female patrons.  
- **Tip % (Tip / Bill)**
- Shows how much percentage people usually tip.
- Youâ€™ll see most people tip 10â€“20% of their bill.
```python  
tips["tip_pct"] = tips["tip"] / tips["total_bill"] * 100  
sns.histplot(tips["tip_pct"], kde=True)  
```  
ðŸ‘‰ Reveals the proportion of the tip relative to the total bill.  
- **Effect of Smoking**  
```python  
sns.boxplot(x="smoker", y="tip", data=tips)  
```  
ðŸ‘‰ Contrasts the tips provided by smokers against those of non-smokers.  
- **Day-wise Analysis**
- If the box for "Sunday" is higher â†’ people spend more on Sundays.  
```python  
sns.boxplot(x="day", y="total_bill", data=tips)  
```

ðŸ‘‰ Identifies which day patrons tend to spend the most.  
- **Pairplot (Overall View)**  
```python  
sns.pairplot(tips, hue="sex")  
```  
ðŸ‘‰ Visualizes numerous relationships concurrently.  
âœ… How you should analyze:  
- Seek patterns (Does a larger bill correlate with a more substantial tip?).  
- Compare demographics (Do men provide larger tips than women? Do smokers tend to spend more?).  
- Examine distributions (Are tips normally distributed? Which day exhibits the highest expenditures?).  
- Grasp percentages (Tip percentage offers a more nuanced understanding than mere tip values).
